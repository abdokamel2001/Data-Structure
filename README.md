# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of the Queue, Stack, Linked List, Linked Queue, and Linked Stack data structures in Java.
Each folder contains an example class with a main method to test the functionality of the implemented data structure.<br>
The Queue and Stack folders contain array-based implementations, while the Linked List, Linked Queue, and Linked Stack folders contain linked list-based implementations.
The linked list-based data structures make use of the Linked List class also contained in this repository.
